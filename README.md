Slides of training. Use [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).  
To generate `slides/assets/network.png`, you'll need dia and some [additional icons](http://blog.admin-linux.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/dia_network_by_fi.zip). Extract it into `/usr/share/dia`. ([Source article](http://blog.admin-linux.org/logiciels-libres/schema-architecture-reseaux-sous-gnu-linux)). Use `/slides/produce-diagram.sh` once icons installed.
